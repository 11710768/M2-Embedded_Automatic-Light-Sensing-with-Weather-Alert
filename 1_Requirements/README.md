## Introduction
Street lights are very essential towards the
development of a city and are unknowingly one of the most
crucial factors in our day-to-day life. The street lights largely
used today are based on providing lighting to citizens but, over
looks on environmental issues such as heat dissipation or the
amount of electricity consumed. As energy-saving and cost
reduction has become crucial right now.
## Research
## Automation based on day and night
This automation refers to turning on the street lights when
the environment does not have ambient light and off when
there is sufficient lighting. This does not require human or
manual operation which causes error thereby not turning
off the light during day time.
## Defining Our System
The street lights have become a very essential part of cities.
It is essential to promote security in installed areas and to
increase the quality of life by artificially extending the hours
in which it is light so that we can live our lives as we do
during the daytime. Street lighting is also essential for the
safety of the citizens to avoid accidents after sunset and alert the weather system.
## SWOT ANALYSIS
## Strength
The additional light also prevents injury, and allows homeowners to feel safer and deter potential home burglars with motion sensor lights that activate when someone steps onto your property or moves close to your home entry points.
## Weakness
Outside, there may occasionally be “false alarms” that set off your lights and lead to disruption, such as a stray cat wandering through the yard or a car passing by. For this reason, proper installation is crucial to avoid unnecessary and unwanted activation.
## Opportunity
Additionally, motion sensor lights conserve power and will help you save on your electric bill. By shutting off automatically when they no longer detect movement, you’ll never have to check if you turned the lights off before bed again.
## Threat
lights will always come on when you enter a room or pass by them. This can feel intrusive and disruptive at night, especially if the light is bright and harms your eyes.

## Who:
Light sensors measure illuminance, which can be used to measure more than the brightness of a light source. Because the illuminance decreases as the sensor moves away from a steady light, the light sensor can be used to gauge relative distance from the source.
## What:
Light sensors are almost always a flat, one-sided surface, so the solid angle occupied by the sensor as viewed from the light source can change depending on its orientation. With the light sensor perpendicular to the direction of the light, it is occupying the largest solid angle possible. As the light sensor rotates away from the light, its solid angle decreases, with the illuminance therefore also decreasing, until the light sensor ultimately detects no direct illuminance when parallel to the light beams or when facing away. This fact can be used to determine the angle of incidence of a light beam on the sensor.
## When:
Light sensors have a lot of uses. The most common use in our daily lives is in cell phones and tablets. Most portable personal electronics now have ambient light sensors used to adjust brightness. If the device can sense that it is in a dark place, it turns down the screen brightness to save power and not surprise the user with a very bright screen.
## Where:
There are many more uses than consumer convenience, however. Detecting intrusion into containers or rooms is an important security application. When shipping expensive cargo, it can be important to know when a shipping container has been opened, so that cases involving loss of product can be solved easier. A cheap photo-resistor could be used to log each time the container is opened, so it can be determined at what point in the process thieves raided the container, or if the sender was being dishonest and claimed the container must have been robbed.
## How:
 A light sensor could also be used for siting the art to a permanent location. Areas near the entrance or windows of a museum could have sunlight too harsh for particular materials, so a light sensor could be used to locate art appropriately. This is similar to the method for siting solar arrays on homes or in fields. It makes no sense to build and install a solar panel in a certain spot if it won’t receive much direct sunlight, so a light sensor is used to find the best placement with the strongest direct sunlight. (As I mentioned, a solar panel is just a very large light sensor, but it’s easier to use a handheld device to test the sunlight than use the panel itself.)
